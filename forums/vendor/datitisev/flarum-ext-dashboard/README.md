### Extending

The dashboard is extendable! Just follow the wiki page [How To Add Your Own Widget](https://github.com/datitisev/flarum-ext-admindashboard/wiki/How-To-Add-Your-Own-Widget), which teaches you how to create an extension from scratch just to extend the dashboard.
If you already have an extension made, scroll to [How To Add Your Own Widget: Creating The Widget Component](https://github.com/datitisev/flarum-ext-admindashboard/wiki/How-To-Add-Your-Own-Widget#creating-the-widget-component).
